          <h3>PANDA</h3>
          <p>
            The giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca, sometimes panda bear or
            simply panda) is a bear species endemic to China. It is
            characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The
            name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red
            panda, a neighboring musteloid. Though it belongs to the order
            Carnivora, the giant panda is a folivore, with bamboo shoots and
            leaves making up more than 99% of its diet. Giant pandas in the wild
            occasionally eat other grasses, wild tubers, or even meat in the
            form of birds, rodents, or carrion. In captivity, they may receive
            honey, eggs, fish, yams, shrub leaves, oranges, or bananas along
            with specially prepared food
          </p>
          <p>
            The giant panda lives in a few mountain ranges in central China,
            mainly in Sichuan, and also in neighbouring Shaanxi and Gansu. As a
            result of farming, deforestation, and other development, the giant
            panda has been driven out of the lowland areas where it once lived,
            and it is a conservation-reliant vulnerable species. A 2007 report
            showed 239 pandas living in captivity inside China and another 27
            outside the country. By December 2014, 49 giant pandas lived in
            captivity outside China, living in 18 zoos in 13 countries. Wild
            population estimates vary; one estimate shows that there are about
            1,590 individuals living in the wild, while a 2006 study via DNA
            analysis estimated that this figure could be as high as 2,000 to
            3,000. Some reports also show that the number of giant pandas in the
            wild is on the rise. By March 2015, the wild giant panda population
            had increased to 1,864 individuals. In 2016, it was reclassified on
            the IUCN Red List from "endangered" to "vulnerable",affirming
            decade-long efforts to save the panda. In July 2021, Chinese
            authorities also reclassified the giant panda as vulnerable.

          <p>
            Despite its taxonomic classification as a carnivoran, the giant
            panda's diet is primarily herbivorous, consisting almost exclusively
            of bamboo.[51] However, the giant panda still has the digestive
            system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes,[55] and
            thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of
            bamboo.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of
            southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo.
