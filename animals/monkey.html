          <h3>MONKEY</h3>
          <p>
            Monkey is a common name that may refer to most mammals of the
            infraorder Simiiformes, also known as the simians. Traditionally,
            all animals in the group now known as simians are counted as monkeys
            except the apes, which constitutes an incomplete paraphyletic
            grouping; however, in the broader sense based on cladistics, apes
            (Hominoidea) are also included, making the terms monkeys and simians
            synonyms in regard to their scope.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many monkey species are tree-dwelling (arboreal), although there are
            species that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. Most
            species are mainly active during the day (diurnal). Monkeys are
            generally considered to be intelligent, especially the Old World
            monkeys. Within suborder Haplorhini, the simians are a sister group
            to the tarsiers – the two members diverged some 70 million years
            ago. New World monkeys and catarrhine monkeys emerged within the
            simians roughly 35 million years ago. Old World monkeys and apes
            emerged within the catarrhine monkeys about 25 million years ago.
            Extinct basal simians such as Aegyptopithecus or Parapithecus (35–32
            million years ago) are also considered monkeys by primatologists

            Monkeys, including apes, can be distinguished from other primates by
            having only two pectoral nipples, a pendulous penis, and a lack of
            sensory whiskers
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            Most monkeys live in the tropical rainforests of Asia, Africa, and
            Central and South America, or the savannas of Africa.
