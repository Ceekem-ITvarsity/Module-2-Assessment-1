          <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
          <p>
            The giraffe is a large African hoofed mammal belonging to the genus
            Giraffa. It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest
            ruminant on Earth. Traditionally, giraffes were thought to be one
            species, Giraffa camelopardalis, with nine subspecies. Most
            recently, researchers proposed dividing them into up to eight extant
            species due to new research into their mitochondrial and nuclear
            DNA, as well as morphological measurements. Seven other extinct
            species of Giraffa are known from the fossil record.

          <p>
            The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely
            long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its spotted coat
            patterns. It is classified under the family Giraffidae, along with
            its closest extant relative, the okapi. Its scattered range extends
            from Chad in the north to South Africa in the south, and from Niger
            in the west to Somalia in the east. Giraffes usually inhabit
            savannahs and woodlands. Their food source is leaves, fruits, and
            flowers of woody plants, primarily acacia species, which they browse
            at heights most other herbivores cannot reach.

            Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas, and African wild dogs may prey upon
            giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their
            offspring or bachelor herds of unrelated adult males, but are
            gregarious and may gather in large aggregations. Males establish
            social hierarchies through "necking", combat bouts where the neck is
            used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females,
            which bear sole responsibility for rearing the young.
          </p>
          <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
          <p>
            Giraffes usually inhabit savannahs and open woodlands. They prefer
            areas dominated by Acacieae, Commiphora, Combretum and Terminalia
            tree over Brachystegia which are more densely spaced. The Angolan
            giraffe can be found in desert environments.[86] Giraffes browse on
            the twigs of trees, preferring those of the subfamily Acacieae and
            the genera Commiphora and Terminalia,[87] which are important
            sources of calcium and protein to sustain the giraffe's growth
            rate.[8] They also feed on shrubs, grass and fruit. A giraffe eats
            around 34 kg (75 lb) of plant matter daily.[43] When stressed,
            giraffes may chew on large branches, stripping them of bark.Giraffes
            are also recorded to chew old bones.
